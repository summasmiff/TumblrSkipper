# TumblrSkipper
A chrome extension to bypass the sidebar when you click a Tumblr link on the Tumblr dashboard.

Clicking a tumblog link on the Tumblr dashboard opens a preview sidebar rather than just opening the blog. This extension fixes that by opening the link in a new tab and keeping your dashboard free of unsightly popups.
